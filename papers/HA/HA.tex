\headertitle{Homotopical Algebra}

\begin{abstract}
    These notes are a gentle introduction to the theory of
    homotopical algebra, also known as higher algebra,
    which has been intensively studied in the recent works of Lurie,
    \cite{htt} and \cite{ha}.
    These thousand-page books make it difficult to get started for the readers 
    who are new to the topic, and these notes will hopefully 
    serve as a facilitation.
    
    We begin by giving motivations, and then,
    we study the theory of model categories and infinity categories,
    as well as the connections between them.
    Finally, we review homological algebra from the higher point of view.

    These notes came from the first half of
    a seminar held by the author in the fall of 2019,
    and every section corresponds to the topic of one week.
    We went on to talk about infinity operads and infinity categorical algebra 
    upon finishing the materials presented in these notes.
