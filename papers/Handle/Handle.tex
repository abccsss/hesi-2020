\title{A Generalised Handle Theory}
\author{Bu Chenjing\footnote{卜辰璟，清华大学数学系数 72 班．}}

\begin{abstract}
    We introduce a variant of the notion of a handlebody,
    in order to apply handle theory to non-compact manifolds.
    As an application, we classify all $2$-manifolds
    with finite topology, obtaining a new proof that
    $\R^2$ has a unique smooth structure.
\end{abstract}

\begin{convention}
    In this paper, the word ``manifold''
    refers to a smooth manifold, possibly with boundary,
    unless otherwise mentioned.
    The boundary of a submanifold is not assumed
    to be contained in the boundary of the ambient manifold.
\end{convention}
